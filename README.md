## How to...

Get ready to play...
1. This website is for single player, not multiplayer. <br>
2. So, to start the game, you'll need one more digital device than the number of players.<br>
3. Open this page on all of the prepared digital devices, and place the device with the largest screen in the center of the table.<br>
Every player must have one digital device with this page open.<br>

During the game...
1. The values of the dice are all randomized, trust us.<br>
2. Press and hold on a specific dice to remove it from the list.<br>
3. press the + button to add a new dice to the far right of the dice list. A 0 means you haven't rolled that dice yet.<br>
4. press the - button to delete the rightmost dice.<br>
5. Each time you take a dice from the center, press firmly to remove it from the device in the center
and add it to your own device.<br>

When the curtain falls...
1. roll the white and black dice... and then... well, you know what happens after that.
There's no automatic summation. Go for it, use your brain!
